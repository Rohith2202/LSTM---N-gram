# LSTM-and-N-gram-model
This code is a combination of both LSTM and N gram model. Instead of the traditional LSTM where a single word is stored for forming LSTM chains we use a set of words ( n grams ) to display outputs for a given text. It is specific to the context but is grammatically incoherent this can be corrected using modules like spacy and nltk.
The second part of the code is the implementation for the metric Jaccardian similarity which finds exactly similar words for a given words in a sentence
