# LSTM-and-N-gram-model
This project is a combination of both LSTM and N gram model. Instead of the traditional LSTM where a single word is stored for forming LSTM chains we use a set of words ( n grams ) to display outputs for a given text. It is specific to the context but is grammatically incoherent this can be corrected using modules like spacy and nltk.
